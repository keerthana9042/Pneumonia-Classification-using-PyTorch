# Overview

  The EfficientNet model is used and is trained on  Pneumonia Chest X-Ray dataset. 
  The dataset consist of nearly 5600 Chest X-Ray images and two categories (Pneumonia/Normal). 
  Our main aim for this project is to build a pneumonia classifier which can classify Chest X-Ray scan that belong to one of the two classes. 
  We will load and fine tune the pretrained EffiecientNet model and also to create a simple pytorch trainer to train the model.

# Why use Efficientnet Model :
  
  In general, The EfficientNet Model achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency over existing CNNs, 
  reducing parameter size by an order of magnitude.

#  Step by Step to perform the project 
  
###  Step 1 : Configure the required datasets and load the packages 
###  Step 2 : Image Transformation and Load Dataset
###  Step 3 : Load dataset into batches 
###  Step 4 : Fine tuning the EfficientNet Model
###  Step 5 : Build a simple Training Model
###  Step 6 : Train the model and determine the accuracy 
###  Step 7 : Plot the results
